# Reads what HafifPix already emits, and stores nothing.
#
# Every install fetches the appcast once a day and downloads a DMG when it
# updates, and GitHub counts both. That is the whole data source: no telemetry
# in the app, no endpoint to run, no file to keep in sync. Homebrew installs
# fetch the same release asset, so they are counted here too.
#
# Release download counts are cumulative and never expire, so there is nothing
# to snapshot — run this whenever you want the current numbers. Traffic is the
# one exception, a rolling 14-day window, and it needs push access on the repo,
# so nobody but the owner can read it.
#
# Every number here is a TOTAL, not a unique count. GitHub exposes no uniques
# for release assets, and the app has no identifier to count with. Treat the
# active-install line as an estimate, and remember that your own downloads
# count exactly like anyone else's.
